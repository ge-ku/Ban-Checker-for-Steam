Chrome and Firefox extension to check bans of people you recently played with (or your friends and groups members).
It also works on [Counter-Strike specific pages](https://steamcommunity.com/id/geku/gcpd/730). To track all your recorded Counter-Strike matches you have to provide your own Steam API key. Otherwise it will only scan last 100 encountered players.

Script works on pages with URIs that follow such patterns:

- \*://steamcommunity.com/id/\*/friends\*
- \*://steamcommunity.com/profiles/\*/friends\*
- \*://steamcommunity.com/groups/\*#members\*
- \*://steamcommunity.com/id/\*/gcpd/730\*
